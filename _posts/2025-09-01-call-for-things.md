        <h1>If you call it, you find it</h1>
        <p>You know that weird thing I do when I lose something? Like, it's usually I misplace my keys or my phone, and I'll start walking around talking out loud to the inanimate object, saying "Mr keys, where are you?" or "Come on, phone, I know you're hiding, where are you!" And then, BAM, a few seconds later, I spot it right there in front of me. It happens all the time in my family, and I feel like the Mindfreak.</p>

        <p>It just happened again with one of my earplugs that I lost in my sleep last night—I was searching for it in the bed, getting frustrated, and as soon as I called out for it, there it was under the pillow, half-hidden in the pillowcase. How does this even work? I decided to look into it because it's works to often to just be luck, or being a Mindfreak.</p>
        <p>Turns out, there's actual science behind it. It's called self-directed speech, where saying the thing's name out loud helps your brain focus better on finding it. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22489646/">Gaz and Dan</a> did experiments where people looked for stuff in pictures or on fake shelves, like finding a coke bottle. When people repeated the name out loud, they found familiar things quicker, about 50 to 100 milliseconds faster—because it lights up a picture in your mind of what you're looking for. But it only helps if you already know what it looks like, otherwise, it might slow you down a bit.</p>
        <p>It also has to do with this part of your brain called the reticular activating system. It's like a filter in your head that decides what to pay attention to out of all the stuff around you. When you say the name aloud, you're basically telling your RAS, "Hey, make this thing stand out!" So, it tunes out the clutter and helps you notice it faster. That's why my lost items seem to pop up like they've been waiting for me to call them.</p>
        <p>Of course, part of it might be me just remembering the times it works and forgetting when it doesn't (confirmation bias) and I know I do a bunch of that. But the studies show it's real, and I'm not just a Mindfreak (unfortunately).</p>
        <p>Anyway, next time I lose something, I'll probably yell for them again. Whether it helps or not, it's a habit now. But at least I know now that it might help.</p>
        <p>Another thought jsut popped in my head, is this the same thing that Jim Carrey did writing himself that <a href="https://youtu.be/P_Wovx6tRnY?si=RI8trX1uRqPGqjXl">$10 million check</a>? Or is it different?</p>
