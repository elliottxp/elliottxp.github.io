        <h1>A happy project.</h1>
        <p>My wife and I sometimes found ourselves unsure of what to do on weekends or during our spare time. One day, I wanted to add a bit of randomness to our plans. So, I took an old box and covered it in green tissue paper. We often argued about always doing what one of us wanted rather than the other. To solve this, I wrote down activities I wanted to do with her on small pieces of paper, scrunched them up, and placed them in the box. She did the same. Before long, we had a box full of our ideas. When we were bored or need something to to, we would take turns pulling ideas out of the green-box at random. This box became a great way to ease tension â€” we could both contribute what we wanted to do, and the final choice would be left up to chance.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share this idea with others, so I created the green-box idea generator at the <a href="https://www.green-box.app" target="_blank">green-box app</a> webpage</p>

        <p>My aim is to help you create healthier, happier habits by inspiring small, meaningful activities every day. I believe even the smallest changes can make a big difference in your wellbeing, in the prime of our green-box use, I felt content.</p>
